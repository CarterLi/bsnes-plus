# bsnes-plus

bsnes-plus (or bsnes+) is a fork of bsnes (based on bsnes-classic) intended to
introduce some new features and improvements, mostly aimed at debugging.

## bsnes-plus with xBRZ filter support

This fork aims to add xBRZ filter support to bsnes-plus, which improves graphics greatly in many old 2D games.
xBRZ can't be merged into bsnes-plus mainline due to imcompatible licenses. So I'll maintain myself.

### Comparation ( See the charactor 'S'):
